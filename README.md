# Biotic Components Analysis

## Analysis conducted by Madison Enda to evaluate biotic cover and habitat distribution in California MPAs, as part of the MarineBioMaps Capstone Project. 

The Pacific Marine and Estuarine Partnership (PMEP) utilized the Coastal & Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) to define major biotic 
- Value 0: Landward Zone
- Value 1: Core Zone (Estuary Overlap)
- Value 2: Core Zone (Shoreline to -30m), State Waters
- Value 3: Core Zone (Shoreline to -30m), Federal Waters
- Value 4: Seaward Zone (-30m to -100m), State Waters
- Value 5: Seaward Zone (-30m to -100m), Federal Waters
- Value 6: Deep Shelf or Channel (-100m to -200m), State Waters
- Value 7: Deep Shelf or Channel (-100m to -200m), Federal Waters
- Value 8: Outside PMEP Score (>-300m) or International Waters

### Data:

.rds files created in the Biota and Substrate repositories from this MarineBioMaps Github Organization were used to load in the PMEP data filtered to California. See those repositories to access these .rds files. 

Shapefiles for CA MPA Boundaries were downloaded from the [California Department of Fish and Wildlife](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/california-marine-protected-areas-ds582).
